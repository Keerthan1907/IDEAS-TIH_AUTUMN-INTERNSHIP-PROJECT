 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing coffee sales data to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior, purchase trends, and spending patterns. Using Google Colab and a dataset sourced from Kaggle, the analysis combines descriptive statistics, inferential testing, and data visualization to answer key business questions.

The main purpose of this project is to help coffee shops understand their customers better and apply data-driven decision-making to improve marketing strategies, inventory management, and sales optimization.

Tools & Technologies Used

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels)

Google Colab for analysis and execution

Kaggle Dataset (Coffee Sales Data)

Statistical Techniques: Chi-Square Test, ANOVA, Correlation Analysis

Visualization: Line plots, Bar plots, Box plots

Key Analyses Performed
1. Descriptive Analysis

Most purchases occur between 10 AM â€“ 6 PM, with a peak around 2 PM.

Average customer spending lies between â‚¹28 â€“ â‚¹36, with a maximum of â‚¹38.7.

Sales are spread across all weekdays, with a slight mid-week concentration.

Monthly analysis showed higher activity in mid-year and towards the end of the year.

2. Inferential Analysis

Chi-Square Test: Sales are not evenly distributed across the day. Mid-day hours dominate (Ï‡Â² = 464.71, p < 0.0001).

ANOVA: No significant variation in spending across weekdays (p = 0.53).

Correlation: A weak positive correlation (r = 0.20) between spending and time of day.

3. Visualization Insights

Monthly Trends: Spending peaks around Mayâ€“June and Octoberâ€“November.

Yearly Comparison: Sales remained stable between 2024 and 2025.

Coffee Type Analysis: Premium drinks like Cappuccino and Latte have higher spending, while Espresso tends to have lower spending.

Applications of the Project

Helps businesses identify peak sales hours for targeted promotions.

Provides insights for inventory planning based on seasonal trends.

Enables data-driven pricing strategies for different coffee types.

Demonstrates how statistical testing validates business assumptions.

ðŸ¤– Role of LLMs in the Project

Assist in writing and debugging Python code.

Interpret complex statistical results in plain language.

Generate structured reports and documentation.

Suggest effective visualization and analysis strategies.

âœ… Conclusion

The analysis confirmed that coffee sales are time-dependent with a strong mid-day concentration, consistent year-to-year, and varying by product type. These findings can guide coffee shop owners in optimizing operations and boosting revenue.

This project enhanced my data analysis, visualization, and statistical reasoning skills while showing how AI tools can streamline the workflow.
